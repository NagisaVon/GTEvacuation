- Players are the authority and the people subject to the drill.
- Situation: fire drill
- Rough outline of game:
	- Game runs in the span of a year (365 days) with a preset drill frequency
		- There is also a preset percent chance of a fire between each drill
		- Evacuees choose whether or not to evacuate in response to the alarm
			- The drill frequency/pattern will affect this as well as when each actual fire happens
